This is Kaixuan. I'm passionate about software development and always eager to tackle new challenges. I have hands-on experience through co-op roles and project work, and I’ll be graduating with my Master’s in December 2024. Before this, I completed my Bachelor's in Computing Science at the University of Alberta. I’m excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to new SWE opportunities in 2025.
