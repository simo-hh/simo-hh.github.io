Welcome to my homepage!

I am excited to share that I am currently pursuing a Master of Engineering in Software Engineering at the <u><a href='https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/'>the University of Waterloo</a></u>. Previously, I completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computing Science with Honors at <u><a href='https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html'>the University of Alberta</a></u>.

Professionally, I have gained valuable experience as a Software Engineer at <u><a href='https://www.mediashaker.com/'>MeidaShaker</a></u> and AB-Seed, where I applied my skills in both software engineering and machine learning. My research interests primarily focus on leveraging machine learning techniques within software engineering to address complex real-world challenges.

I am actively seeking software and website development related new-graduate positions for Fall 2025, as well as part-time opportunities that allow me to further develop and apply my technical skills.
