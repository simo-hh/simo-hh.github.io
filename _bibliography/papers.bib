      abstract={Phishing attacks pose a significant threat to Internet users, with cybercriminals elaborately replicating the visual appearance of legitimate websites to deceive victims. Visual similarity-based detection systems have emerged as an effective countermeasure, but their effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios have been unexplored. In this paper, we comprehensively scrutinize and evaluate state-of-the-art visual similarity-based anti-phishing models using a large-scale dataset of 450K real-world phishing websites. Our analysis reveals that while certain models maintain high accuracy, others exhibit notably lower performance than results on curated datasets, highlighting the importance of real-world evaluation. In addition, we observe the real-world tactic of manipulating visual components that phishing attackers employ to circumvent the detection systems. To assess the resilience of existing models against adversarial attacks and robustness, we apply visible and perturbation-based manipulations to website logos, which adversaries typically target. We then evaluate the models' robustness in handling these adversarial samples. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities in several models, emphasizing the need for more robust visual similarity techniques capable of withstanding sophisticated evasion attempts. We provide actionable insights for enhancing the security of phishing defense systems, encouraging proactive actions. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first large-scale, systematic evaluation of visual similarity-based models for phishing detection in real-world settings, necessitating the development of more effective and robust defenses.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
