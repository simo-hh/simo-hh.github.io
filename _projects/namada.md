The project is Namada Directory, a tailored software solution developed through continuous interaction and feedback from Alberta’s Social Economy Ecosystem Development (<a href='https://www.ab-seed.ca/'>AB Seed</a>). This directory is a free digital tool designed to assist social purpose businesses by streamlining the search for support and resources. It offers users the ability to apply various filters to receive a curated list of relevant financial opportunities and resources tailored to their specific needs. This iterative process ensured that the final product was not only functional but also perfectly aligned with the client’s expectations and requirements. Our journey began with understanding their operational needs, which guided our design and development process. The objective was clear: to create a directory that not only served as an informational hub but also enhanced the operational capabilities of AB Seed. Our engagement spanned the entire development lifecycle, from initial design sketches and system architecture to the coding, testing, and final delivery of the project.

One of the primary challenges we faced in the Namada Directory project was transforming AB Seed's originally unmaintainable website, built on bubble.io, into a robust, maintainable platform. To achieve this, we provided a responsive design overhaul, database restructuring and migration, and a complete rebuild of the frontend and backend systems. Throughout the development process, which spanned from December 2022 to April 2023, I was specifically responsible for developing key features including the user profile management and resources search filtering.

Our efforts culminated in a handover of the source code to AB Seed, who expressed satisfaction and surprise at the speed of our development. The Namada Directory is now maintained and updated by AB Seed’s technical team, ensuring its ongoing efficacy and support for social purpose businesses.
