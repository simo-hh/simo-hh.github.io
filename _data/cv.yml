        - title: Malware Detection
          contents:
            - Developed a diffusion-based model to augment network traffic datasets by converting traffic into images and employing a novel forward-reverse diffusion process, enhancing the detection capabilities against obfuscated malware through the generation of synthetic traffic images.
            - Designed and tested adversarial training techniques to introduce and counteract noise at the packet level, achieving high fidelity in synthetic image generation, which aids in improving the robustness of malware classifiers against evasion tactics.
        - title: Phishing Detection
          contents:
            - Evaluated visual similarity-based anti-phishing models on a dataset of 450K real-world phishing websites to measure their effectiveness and robustness, uncovering significant performance disparities compared to curated datasets and identifying vulnerabilities in several models.
            - Conducted adversarial testing by applying visual manipulations to website logos, a common target in phishing attacks, to assess the resilience of detection systems against sophisticated evasion attempts, providing actionable insights for enhancing the security of phishing defense systems.
